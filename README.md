# Vite SASS Boilerplate

This boilerplate sets up a vite project with SASS installed and a 7-1 directory structure typically used for SASS projects.

The boilerplate also include:

- Normalize.css stylesheet
- A popular css reset stylesheet
- A breakpoints stylesheet that includes mixin for standard breakpoints with modern css @media-query syntax
- A functions stylesheet that includes functions to convert pixel values to rem and em.
- A mixins stylesheet with a flexbox mixin that sets up default values for flexbox when used.

#### I set this up for my future projects.
