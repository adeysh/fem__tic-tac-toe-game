## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person
- Bonus 1: Save the game state in the browser so that itâ€™s preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- Bonus 2: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so itâ€™s proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/) - Build tool

### What I learned

- Learned about building game logic from scratch.
- Learned about how to do state management and cautious about changing it accidently.
- Learned about how to split functionality to workflow functions, logic functions and helper functions
- Learned about implementing different game winning stratergies (particular for a game like tic-tac-toe)

### What I added

- Users can choose CPU difficulty when playing with CPU. Options include easy, medium, hard and unbeatable.
- The difficulties are just stratergies that cpu performs to maximize its chances of winning
- The unbeatable mode is an application of [Minimax Algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y2a0Zhgq0U) that always ends up with either a draw of CPU winning. This was made just for fun ðŸ˜‚
- Users can quit the game in-between after confirming that they want to quit.

### Continued development

- Adding an indicator that shows how many rounds have been played.
- Adding a settings menu that has typical game settings (theme, winning-turns, difficulty)
- Adding personalized messages based on the results of the game.

### Useful resources
